I build software that enables the world I want to see – often at the intersection of technology and the public interest.

## What I'm Building Today
*   I lead Product and R&D at [Consumer Reports Innovation Lab](lab.cr.org). My teams are advancing data & digital rights through new research and new tools. [Permission Slip](permissionslipcr.com) and [Data Rights Protocol](datarightsprotocol.org) are two of the more mature projects in our portfolio.
