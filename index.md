I’m interested in how digital systems shape our choices — and how we might redesign them to better serve the people behind the screens.

## What I'm Building Today

I lead [**Product R&D at Consumer Reports**](https://www.consumerreports.org/about-us/our-people/our-experts/ginny-fahs/), where I work on ways to help people navigate the messier parts of modern tech. My portfolio spans agentic AI, data rights, digital safety, and trust.

My team’s prototypes have grown into popular consumer apps and technical standards, including:

*   [**AskCR**](https://www.consumerreports.org/askcr/), a conversational AI experience and RAG application built to deliver trusted product advice; it’s now considered a hero feature of CR membership. 

*   [**Permission Slip**](https://permissionslipcr.com/), a privacy rights app that received significant media attention including in [_The Washington Post_](https://wapo.st/43sNBtM) and on [_The Today Show_](https://www.today.com/video/how-to-protect-your-digital-devices-and-privacy-online-202613317789). 

*   [**Data Rights Protocol**](https://datarightsprotocol.org/), an industry-facing technical standard for standardizing and streamlining data rights requests. 

[Our lab](https://innovation.consumerreports.org/) builds in the open, often partnering with industry and academia to explore new patterns for consumer agency in real-world settings.

Beyond CR, I love nurturing early talent and work. I support young tech ventures as a board member at the [Digital Harbor Foundation](https://digitalharbor.org/), and help grow the next generation of tech leaders as a [lecturer](https://sps.columbia.edu/person/ginny-fahs) in Columbia’s Masters in Technology Management program.

## What I've Built
*   I was a [tech policy fellow](https://aspenpolicyacademy.org/person/ginny-fahs/) at The Aspen Institute, where I explored [cybersecurity for older adults](https://aspenpolicyacademy.org/resource/impact-case-study-ginny-fahs/) and brought [agile methods to policymaking](https://www.aspentechpolicyhub.org/project/test-driven-development/).

*   I co-founded [#MovingForward](http://venturemovingforward.org), a social movement spanning 175+ VC firms in 24 countries; firms committed to address harassment and discrimination through strong corporate policies.

*   I worked at Uber as a Software Engineer, building back-end CX and refund algorithms that fire any time you have a problem with an Uber Eats order.

## Just For Fun
*   I sing in a community choir, host overly ambitious theme parties, and play ukulele and piano with joyful mediocrity. 

*   I believe third spaces matter, and participate in a number of gathering experiments across NYC (offbeat salons, defunct social clubs, community living…)

*   As part of an art collective, we broke the Guinness World Record for world’s [longest phone call](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/1/23/world-record-longest-phone-call/).

*   I majored in American History & Literature, writing my senior thesis about meme culture before it was a hot topic.

## Building Together
*   I advise, support, and sometimes angel invest in early-stage teams.

*   Curious what it’s like to work with me? I wrote a [user guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZkApkfMUoy6zIXFU1m5fBYR5fO6VtGcujttOs0xrjGQ/edit?usp=sharing).
