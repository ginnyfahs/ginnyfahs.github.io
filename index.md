Insert some sort of bio here!

## Activism
*   I am the Co-Founder & Executive Director of [#MovingForward](https://wearemovingforward.github.io/), a global social movement highlighting VCs committed to diverse, inclusive, and harassment-free workplaces. 
_Press: WIRED, CNN, Recode, Pando, Bloomberg, and Institutional Investor._

## Code
*   I do backend, frontend, and iOS. Techies call this full stack.
*   I was a software engineer at [Uber](https://www.uber.com/), where I built the backend for global phone support. I also built self-serve refund algorithims and a brand new [delivery experience](https://mashable.com/article/uber-eats-redesign-app-progress-tracking/#UOO8659wMaq1) on iOS for [Uber Eats](https://www.ubereats.com/en-US/). 
*   I'm intrigued by voice UIs and what it means to code a conversation. I've built an Alexa app for baking my favorite [banana bread](https://github.com/ginnyfahs/choc-chip-banana-bread), and prototyped Uber Eats on Alexa for a company hackathon.
