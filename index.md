Equal parts advocate and builder, I believe technology is telling the story of our time. I select for projects that expand equity and access, and put information in people’s hands when they need it most.

## ./ Policy
*   I am the Co-Founder & Executive Director of [#MovingForward](https://wearemovingforward.github.io/), a global social movement using policy to create a more diverse, inclusive, and harassment-free venture capital industry (more in _[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/change-harassment-silicon-valley-change-law/597373/), [WIRED](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/movingforward-sexism-vc-ellen-pao), [CNN](https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/08/technology/movingforward-tech-vc-harassment/index.html), [Recode](https://www.recode.net/2018/3/8/17094632/venture-capital-sexual-harassment-policies-moving-forward-directory), [Pando](https://pando.com/2018/03/08/beyond-metoo-new-initiative-movingforward-seeks-hold-newly-shaken-silicon-valley-accountable/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-03-22/next-steps-for-movingforward-and-metoo-video)_, and _[Institutional Investor](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b17hndr10zmwwb/venture-capital-has-a-%E2%80%98metoo%E2%80%99-problem-have-investors-been-ignoring-it)_).
*   I was a tech policy fellow at [The Aspen Institute](https://aspentechpolicyhub.org), where I worked on [cybersecurity for older adults](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/23/new-research-pinpoints-how-elderly-people-are-targeted-in-online-scams.html?fbclid=IwAR0oNY5QvkxLxC1ojg7a3_TQYeKfrKwj9jpyNW4IAp58zYXvgDRRSmvSRQg) and utilizing [software development techniques in policymaking](https://www.aspentechpolicyhub.org/project/test-driven-development/).
*   I marched on Washington for reproductive rights [before I could walk](https://medium.com/@GlowHQ/the-womens-march-a-reflection-d7bb4049e5ee), and launched the [Eve app](https://glowing.com/eve), putting critical birth control and sexual health information in the pockets of millions worldwide.

## ./ Code
*   I am fullstack: backend, frontend, and iOS.
*   I was a software engineer at [Uber](https://www.uber.com/), where I built the backend for global phone support. I also built self-serve refund algorithims and a brand new [delivery experience](https://mashable.com/article/uber-eats-redesign-app-progress-tracking/#UOO8659wMaq1) on iOS for [Uber Eats](https://www.ubereats.com/en-US/). 
*   I'm intrigued by voice UIs and what it means to code a conversation. I've built an Alexa Skill for baking my favorite [banana bread](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CBWM1/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1507656315&sr=1-1&keywords=chocolate+banana+bread+recipe), and prototyped Uber Eats on Alexa for a company hackathon.
